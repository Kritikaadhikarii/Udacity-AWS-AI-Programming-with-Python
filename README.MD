# AI Programming with Python

Hi everyone, I'm Kritika Adhikari, a software engineer and a UI/UX designer. I've completed the AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program from Udacity. 

Getting into this program was very exciting and a challenging journey for me. From getting first place from Nepal in deepracer competition to attempting the prerequisite quiz and finally waiting for almost a month to get into the program, it was a roller coaster ride. At last, I got into the program and it was a great experience.

This program has taught me so much, while I already had some knowledge of Python, I'd like to maybe say that this program has indeed helped me revise everything and clear out any confusions that I had. As the course progresses, I'll be adding all of the contents that I learned in this program here. Simultaneously, I'll also be uploading this readme too.

So here's what the repo will contain:

- Notes on what I learned in the program.
- Projects that I completed in the program.
- Any additional resources that I found useful.
- Personal notes and suggestions. 

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or suggestions.
